The American Sign Language Detector with Custom Hand Signs is a Python project designed to recognize and interpret American Sign Language gestures in real-time. This project incorporates a machine learning model for gesture recognition and allows users to add and customize their own hand signs.

## Features

- Real-time detection and interpretation of American Sign Language gestures.
- Integration of a machine learning model built with Keras for accurate gesture recognition.
- Utilizes OpenCV for image processing and real-time video capture.
- Ability to add and customize new hand signs according to user preferences.
- Simple and intuitive user interface for ease of use.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- Machine Learning (TensorFlow)
- Keras
- NumPy
- SciPy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/18Aswin/American-Sign-Language-Detector.git
```

2. Run the application:

```
python main.py
```

## Usage
